# Rationale

* Technology shift: desktop PC → laptop, tablet, smartphone, cloud; mobile, power- aware, concurrent, real-time, connected - 技术转变：台式电脑→笔记本电脑、平板电脑、智能手机、云；移动、电源意识、并发、实时、连接
* But still programmed in C, running some variant of Unix – technology stack that’s becoming increasing limiting- 但仍然用C语言编程，运行一些Unix的变体--技术堆栈正变得越来越有局限性
* This course will explore new techniques for safer, more effective, systems programming- 本课程将探索更安全、更有效的系统编程的新技术
  * Programming in an unmanaged environment, where data layout and performance matter- 在无人管理的环境中编程，数据布局和性能很重要
  * Operating systems kernels, device drivers, low-level networking code - 操作系统内核、设备驱动、低级网络代码

我们已经从一个由运行Windows的台式电脑主导的世界，以及相对较少的服务器（通常位于现场）来支持这些电脑，到一个由智能手机和云计算主导的世界。现在的设备更有可能是移动和电池供电的，并连接到一个网络，让它们把计算和数据卸载到在专用数据中心运行的远程云计算资源。这改变了我们使用这些设备的方式，以及我们可以使用的应用程序的类型。

而这种转变的一部分是，我们越来越多地在智能手机、平板电脑和其他通用计算设备上使用实时应用程序，如电话、视频会议或流媒体视频。而这些应用是由越来越多的服务器驱动的。这些服务器不是由电池供电或移动的，但随着数据中心运营商努力减少运营其服务的电力和空调成本，并减少对环境的影响，它们也越来越具有电源意识。

而且，我们使用的设备也越来越多地兼而有之。在某种程度上，这是因为数据中心是一个天然的并发性家园。运行同一服务的数百万个实例以满足不同用户的需求。但是，这也部分是因为控制功耗的需要推动了移动CPU向多核支持的方向发展。这些天来，所有东西都是多核系统。尽管有这些大规模的转变，底层的操作系统和软件栈的变化相对较小。

* 例如，我的智能手机上的操作系统与我在1992年使用的桌面工作站运行相同的底层软件栈。它使用相同的操作系统内核，使用相同的编程语言进行编程，并共享许多相同的软件库、API和功能。
* 当然，代码已经发展和改变，但组织、架构和编写系统的基本方法仍然惊人地相似。该技术和编程模型的局限性越来越大。

在本课程中，我们将探索一些新的技术和方法，旨在支持更安全、更有效的系统编程。**我们将谈论编程语言的进步，它使我们能够保留系统编程语言的优势，如C，在对数据表示的控制和高性能方面，同时更加安全和容易编程**。

我们将讨论操作系统如何改变，以更好地支持设备驱动程序的编写者，水平网络代码，等等，目的是提高整个系统的安全和保障。 

We’ve gone from a world dominated by desktop PCs running Windows, with a relatively small number of servers, often located on site, which support those PCs, to a world dominated by smartphones and cloud computing. Devices are now much more likely to be mobile and battery powered, and connected to a network that lets them offload computation and data to remote cloud computing resources running in dedicated data centers. This changes the way we use those devices, and the type of applications we can use. And part of that shift is that we’re increasingly using real time applications like telephony, video conferencing, or streaming video, on our smartphones, tablets, and other general purpose computing devices. And these applications are powered by an increasing number of servers. These servers are not battery powered or mobile, but are also, increasingly, power aware as data centre operators strive to reduce the electricity and air conditioning costs of operating their services, and to reduce their environmental impact. And the devices, we use her also increasingly concurrent. In part, this is because a data centre is a natural home for concurrency. Running millions of instances of the same service to meet the needs of different users. But it's also, in part, because of the need to control power consumption has pushed mobile CPUs in the direction of multi-core support. These days, everything is a multi-core system. Despite these massive shifts, the underlying operating system and software stack has changed relatively little. The operating system on my smartphone runs the same underlying software stack as the desktop workstation I used in 1992, for example. It uses the same operating system kernel, it's programmed using the same programming language and shares many of the same software libraries, API's and features. The Code has evolved and changed, of course, but the organization, architecture, and underlying approaches to writing the system remain surprisingly similar. The technology, and programming model, is increasingly limiting. In this course we'll explore some new techniques and approaches that aim to support safer, and more effective, systems programming. We'll talk about advances in programming languages that allow us to retain the advantages of systems programming languages, such as C, in terms of control over data representations and high performance, while being much safer and easier to program. And we'll talk about how operating systems might change, to better support writers of device drivers, level networking code, and so on, with the goal of improving the safety and security of the overall system.
