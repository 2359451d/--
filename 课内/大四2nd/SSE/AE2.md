You are part of security analyst group that is meeting with clients to discuss various implementations of security models in an information system that is being put together. The clients have initially decided on confidentiality and Integrity policies going forward and tables 1 and 2 illustrate their subject and object classifications with associated clearance levels. They have explained to you that there are three security levels L1, L2, L3 such that L3 is the highest and L1 is the lowest permission classification. Both classifications are used for Integrity and Confidentiality. There are Confidentiality category sets A, B and C whilst Integrity category sets are as follows X, Y, Z.你是安全分析小组的一员，该小组正在与客户会面，讨论正在建立的信息系统中的各种安全模式的实施。客户已经初步决定了未来的保密性和完整性政策，表1和表2说明了他们的主体和对象分类以及相关的许可级别。他们已经向你解释了有三个安全级别L1、L2、L3，其中L3是最高的，L1是最低的许可分类。这两种分类都是用于完整性和保密性的。有保密性类别集A、B和C，而完整性类别集如下X、Y、Z。

Q1

You have been asked to implement the Simple Security and Integrity Star properties. Fill out table 4 to indicate any applicable read or write permissions between the different subjects and objects. **Treat this as a loose model such that only one property should provide a relation for it to be valid.** **Cross reference** the Discretionary Access Model presented in table 3 to arrive at the final permissible relations. When cross referencing, the discretionary model should confirm the possible relations provided by the mandatory model for the relation to be valid. 你被要求实现简单安全和完整*属性。填写表4，指出不同主体和对象之间任何适用的读或写权限。把它当作一个松散的模型，这样只有一个属性应该提供一个关系才是有效的。交叉引用表3中的自由裁量访问模型，以得出最终允许的关系。当交叉引用时，自由裁量模型应该确认强制性模型所提供的可能的关系，这样关系才是有效的。
