# Task1

#### Q1

<!-- You are part of security analyst group that is meeting with clients to discuss various implementations of security models in an information system that is being put together. The clients have initially decided on confidentiality and Integrity policies going forward and tables 1 and 2 illustrate their subject and object classifications with associated clearance levels. They have explained to you that there are three security levels L1, L2, L3 such that L3 is the highest and L1 is the lowest permission classification. Both classifications are used for Integrity and Confidentiality. There are Confidentiality category sets A, B and C whilst Integrity category sets are as follows X, Y, Z.你是安全分析小组的一员，该小组正在与客户会面，讨论正在建立的信息系统中的各种安全模式的实施。客户已经初步决定了未来的保密性和完整性政策，表1和表2说明了他们的主体和对象分类以及相关的许可级别。他们已经向你解释了有三个安全级别L1、L2、L3，其中L3是最高的，L1是最低的许可分类。这两种分类都是用于完整性和保密性的。有保密性类别集A、B和C，而完整性类别集如下X、Y、Z。 -->

<!-- You have been asked to implement the Simple Security and Integrity Star properties. Fill out table 4 to indicate any applicable read or write permissions between the different subjects and objects. Treat this as a loose model such that only one property should provide a relation for it to be valid. Cross reference the Discretionary Access Model presented in table 3 to arrive at the final permissible relations. When cross referencing, the discretionary model should confirm the possible relations provided by the mandatory model for the relation to be valid. 你被要求实现简单安全和完整*属性。填写表4，指出不同主体和对象之间任何适用的读或写权限。把它当作一个松散的模型，这样只有一个属性应该提供一个关系才是有效的。交叉引用表3中的自由裁量访问模型，以得出最终允许的关系。当交叉引用时，自由裁量模型应该确认强制性模型所提供的可能的关系，这样关系才是有效的。-->

**Solution**:

Given the security levels and category set in terms of confidentiality and integrity. (there are three security levels L1, L2, L3 such that L3 is the highest and L1 is the lowest permission classification)

We use access rights calculated from BLP and Biba models then cross reference with given ACM to derive final output.

Properties covered:

* BLP
  * **simple security** - no read up
    * iff L(o)≤L(s), and C(o)⊆C(s)
  * **star** - no write down
    * iff L(s)≤L(o), and C(s)⊆C(o)
* Biba
  * **simple integrity** - no read down
    * iff i(s)≤i(o), and C(s)⊆C(o)
  * **integrity star** - no write up
    * iff i(o)≤i(s), and C(o)⊆C(s)

Output of MAC:

\ | O1 | O2 | O3 | O4
---------|----------|---------|----------|---------
 S1 | rw | rw | r | -
 S2 | rw | r | w | rw
 S3 | - | - | - | rw
 S4 | rw | w | - | rw
 S5 | rw | - | - | rw

Final output while taking DAC into consideration:

\ | O1 | O2 | O3 | O4
---------|----------|---------|----------|---------
 S1 | rw | r | - | -
 S2 | - | r | w | r
 S3 | - | - | - | w
 S4 | rw | - | - | r
 S5 | rw | - | - | rw

# Task2

<!-- Questions 1 and 2 concern this following scenario. You are consulting with stakeholders concerning proposed changes to a security policy. There are three security levels L1, L2, L3 such that L1 < L2 < L3 (i.e. level 3 is the highest level of clearance and level 1 is the lowest). The Integrity Star property has been applied to this scenario. One of the access rights for a user is represented as Sα with a category set of {A, B}. Sα has been assigned the security level L2 and has write access to an object Oβ with a security level of L1 and a category set of {A}.问题1和2涉及下面这个场景。你正在与利益相关者协商关于安全政策的拟议修改。有三个安全级别L1、L2、L3，这样L1<L2<L3（即3级是最高级别的权限，1级是最低级别）。完整性*属性已被应用于这种情况。一个用户的访问权限被表示为Sα，其类别集为{A，B}。Sα被分配到安全级别为L2，并且对安全级别为L1、类别集为{A}的对象Oβ有写入权限。 -->

From the task context, it is known that given integrity star property i.e. no write up allowed(iff i(o)≤i(s), and C(o)⊆C(s))

Access right for a user `Sα` could be expressed as `L2{A,B}`. And has write access to object `Oβ` - `L1{A}`.

#### Q1

If the category set of `Oβ` is changed to `∅`, what is the consequence of this action?

**Solution**:

If the category set is changed to empty set, the access right (write) of user `Sα` to the object would not be changed, as the user still dominates the object, and integrity level `i(o)≤i(s)` remains.

#### Q2

In addition to the changes in Q1, if the simple security property is applied to the scenario, what is the consequence of this action?

**Solution**:

After the category set is changed to empty set, if the simple security property is applied and using the same category set for confidentiality.

As the confidentiality property of the user could be expressed as `L2{A,B}` and that of the subject as `L1{∅}`. Consider the simple security property, the subject dominates the objects and `L(o)≤L(s)` holds. So a read access of user `Sα` to object `Oβ` is granted.

#### Q3

![](/static/2022-03-11-18-27-40.png)

<!-- Question 3 concerns this model in figure 1 which illustrates some relation between a subject S1 and an object O1. Here we have three security levels that apply to both the subject and object. The category sets have been omitted and do not need to be considered. There are three security levels here L1 < L2 < L3 such that L1 is the lowest and L3 is the highest security level.问题 3 涉及图 1 中的这个模型，它说明了主体 S1 和对象 O1 之间的某种关系。这里我们有适用于主体和客体的三个安全级别。**类别集已被省略**，不需要考虑。这里有三个安全级别 L1 < L2 < L3，因此 L1 是最低的，L3 是最高的安全级别。 -->

<!-- Assuming the **Low Watermark Policy for Objects and the Invocation Property** have been applied to the model in figure 1 describe what relations can exist between the subject and the objects permitted by the security conditions.假设**对象低水标策略和调用属性**已应用于图 1 中的模型，描述安全条件允许的主体和对象之间可以存在的关系 -->

**Solution**:

It is known that Low Watermark Policy for Objects has no restrictions on subjects to modify any objects, any subjects can modify any objects regardless of integrity level. So

S1 has write acesses to O1, O2, O3

And Low Watermark Policy for Objects has no effect on Invocation Property (𝑠1 ∈ 𝑆 can invoke 𝑠2 ∈ 𝑆 iff 𝑖(𝑠2)	≤ 𝑖(𝑠1)). So if this model involves other subjects with integrity level less or equal than L2, then subject 1 can invoke them. Though there are no other subjects in this model.

#### Q4

<!-- Question 4 relates to this model in figure 2, which illustrates some relations between a subject and objects. The category sets have been omitted and do not need to be considered. There are three security levels here (not illustrated) L1 < L2 < L3 such that L1 is the lowest and L3 is the highest security level. Consider the following constraints: The security levels the Subject and Object 1 are not equivalent. Furthermore, the security level of Object 1 dominates that of Object 2.问题4与图2中的这个模型有关，它说明了主体和客体之间的一些关系。类别集被省略了，不需要考虑。这里有三个安全级别（没有图示）L1 < L2 < L3，这样L1是最低的，L3是最高的安全级别。考虑下面的约束。主体和客体1的安全级别是不相等的。此外，对象1的安全级别支配着对象2的安全级别。 -->

<!-- 如果关于上述约束可以观察到以下关系，则该模型应用了哪两个 BLP/Biba 属性？ -->

![](/static/2022-03-11-18-56-20.png)

What two BLP/Biba properties have been applied to this model in the event the following relations are observable with respect to the aforementioned constraints? 

• Subject r Object 1
• Subject w/r Object 2
• Subject w/r Object 3

<!-- 已知，Subject和O1安全级别不相等，Subject和O2，O3安全级别相同。 O1 doms O2 所以，C(o2)⊆C(o1) -->

**Solution**:

Given the question context, it is known that the security levels of Subject and Object 1 is not the same, i.e. `L(s)!=L(o1)` while Subject has the same security levels with Object 2,3 i.e. `L(s)=L(o2)=L(o3)`. Also, security level of Object 1 dominates Object 2 i.e. `L(o2)<L(o1)` holds

From the constraints, **simple integrity property** could be applied here. Since no read down is allowed and subject has the same security levels with object 2,3 so `i(s)≤i(o2)` and `i(s)≤i(o3)` holds. Additionally, security level of Object 1 dominates Object 2 i.e. `L(o2)<L(o1)`, so `i(s)<i(o1)` holds. Subject has read rights to all the objects.

Also, we apply the **integrity star property** on the model, so if subject has been granted write rights to Object 2, 3 it means that `i(o2)≤i(s)` and `i(o3)≤i(s)` holds. Since the security level of Object 1 dominates that of Object 2 i.e. `i(o2)<i(o1)`, and subject has the same security levels with Object 2,3, then `i(s)<i(o1)`, which the relation "Subject r Object 1" holds (as subject has no write right to object 1).

As we know that by the simple security property of BLP model, where no read up is allowed, and security level of Object 1 dominates Object 2 i.e. `L(o2)<L(o1)`, however, subject should have read right to object 1 which requires `L(o1)≤L(s)`, so there exists the contradiction as the security levels of subject and o1 is not the same and o1 has higher level. Obviously, we cannot apply BLP model properties on this model.
