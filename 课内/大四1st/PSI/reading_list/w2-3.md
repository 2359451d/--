# 1.伟大的科技带来伟大的责任：With Great Tech Comes Great Responsibility

Individuals must consider the implications of their work, this can be challenging: (1) depending on the role of the individual (graduate or established), (2) in terms of scale of the organisation (start-up or multinational) and (3) primary profit source of employer (consumer or government client). **个人必须考虑其工作的影响**，这可能是具有挑战性的: (1)取决于个人的角色(毕业生或已建立) ，(2)取决于组织的规模(初创企业或跨国企业) ，(3)雇主的主要利润来源(消费者或政府客户)。

Tech has made many promises. Silicon Valley constantly seeks to improve our lives, releasing devices and services that seek to optimize our work and heighten our play. It has pledged to solve global challenges, with an almost fanatical belief in the power of code to solve the thorniest issues of our time, from the political to the economic to the environmental. It is, to a small but very powerful segment of society, the force most responsible for the transformation of our society. 科技公司做出了许多承诺。硅谷不断地寻求**改善我们的生活，释放设备和服务，寻求优化我们的工作和提高我们的游戏。它承诺解决全球性的挑战，几乎狂热地相信代码的力量可以解决我们这个时代最棘手的问题，从政治到经济再到环境。对于社会中的一小部分人来说，它是对我们社会转型负有最大责任的力量**。【 不算论点论据把，只算正面背景，，科技的优点

The reality is that though technology has provided us with many new tools, the industry has also been minimally transparent on how it recognizes, addresses, and takes responsibility for myriad ethical issues that have arisen from the widespread adoption of its products and services.现实情况是，**尽管技术为我们提供了许多新工具，但该行业在如何识别、处理和承担因广泛采用其产品和服务而产生的【无数伦理问题】方面的透明度也很低**。【不算论点论据把，只算反面背景，，科技带来的无数伦理问题，然后引出学生改善科技领域的伦理问题】

The ethical issues facing the tech industry are abundant — military contracts, invasive data mining, biased algorithms, inhumane warehouse conditions, racist facial recognition software, and more. Addressing ethical issues in tech can be overwhelming for students interested in working in tech. But change in the industry is not impossible. And it is, increasingly, necessary. 科技行业面临的【**道德问题】很多**ーー军事合同、侵入性数据挖掘、带有偏见的算法、不人道的仓库条件、带有种族主义色彩的面部识别软件等等【反相关补充】。**对于有兴趣从事技术工作的学生来说，解决技术领域的道德问题可能是压倒性的。但改变这个行业【并非不可能】。而且，这是越来越必要的【（哪里看出来重要了，有点单薄，真的重要吗？最好能给出重要的原因，基于后续提到的什么东西能说解决这些伦理问题很重要?**】。【论点？针对学生来说，（考虑到角色）其涉及的工作*解决技术领域的道德问题（具有挑战性，道德问题，但不是不可能】

The first step is recognizing that those who build tech have always faced ethical challenges and that all tech workers, from warehouse workers to software developers, have always been at the forefront of organizing for change. By learning from the history of tech worker organizing and understanding the tactics used by tech workers today, students entering the tech industry can be empowered to improve the future of tech and the future of society 第一步是认识到那些建造技术的人总是面临着道德挑战，所有的技术工人，从仓库工人到软件开发人员，总是站在组织变革的最前沿。通过**学习科技工作者组织的历史和理解当今科技工作者使用的策略，进入科技产业的学生能够改善科技的未来和社会的未来**【总体观点：技术领域肯定一直涉及道德伦理问题，然后为什么学生改善就可能了，，，】

## Timeline

A group called Computer People for Peace formed in New York City and petitions the Association for Computing Machinery to adopt principles opposed to the Vietnam War, foreign wars, discrimination in tech, and software that violates user privacy. The group was involved in various organizing over the years, including the production of a newsletter called Interrupt, the distribution of anti-war pamphlets, and a campaign for the release of the Black Panther and computer programmer Clark Squire.一个名为计算机人民和平的组织在纽约成立，他们请求计算机机械协会采用反对越南战争、对外战争、技术歧视和侵犯用户隐私的软件的原则【道德问题？】。这些年来，该组织参与了各种组织活动，包括制作一份名为《中断》的通讯，分发反战小册子，以及发起释放黑豹党和程序员克拉克随从的运动。

We oppose the war in Vietnam, U.S. military presence throughout the world, and economic and political subversion of other nations. We oppose discrimination as practiced in the computer field. We oppose the establishment of mass data banks which pose a threat to our privacy. — Computer People for Peace 我们反对越南战争，反对美国在世界各地的军事存在，反对对其他国家的经济和政治颠覆。我们反对在计算机领域实行的歧视。我们反对建立对我们的隐私构成威胁的大规模数据库。ー计算机人员促进和平

That same year, a collection of professors, students, technology workers, and others formed Science for the People to protest the involvement of the scientific community in the military and the use of science in military endeavors. 同年，一群教授、**学生**、技术工作者和其他人组成了人民科学组织，抗议科学界参与军事活动和将科学用于军事活动。

The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) was founded after manufacturing leaks at IBM and Fairchild Electronics caused widespread birth defects and health issues for communities in Silicon Valley. Members of the community, tech workers, law 3 enforcement, emergency workers, and environmental activists banded together in response to the crisis, forming SVTC. Since its founding, SVTC has led multiple education campaigns on proper disposal methods for hazardous materials in the tech industry and conducted research on the effects of such materials on workers and the community. 在 IBM 和飞兆电子公司的制造泄漏导致硅谷社区出现大范围的出生缺陷和健康问题之后，硅谷毒物联盟成立了。社区成员、技术工作者、执法部门、应急工作者和环保活动家联合起来应对危机，成立了 SVTC。自成立以来，该中心领导了关于技术行业危险材料适当处置方法的多项教育活动，并就此类材料对工人和社区的影响开展了研究。

An organizing drive among largely-immigrant janitors at Shine Maintenance, an Apple contractor, saw over 130 people join the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 1877. Once the company became aware of the union drive, it began requiring residency documentation; almost none could provide the required verification and were fired.5 The campaign kicked off a series of janitorial union drives, resulting in a contract with Apple janitors in 1992, another contract at Hewlett-Packard, and hundreds of new members for SEIU.苹果承包商炫维修公司(Shine Maintenance)的清洁工主要是移民，他们组织了一次活动，有130多人加入了服务业雇员国际联盟(SEIU)地方1877。一旦公司意识到工会的努力，它开始要求居住文件，几乎没有人能够提供所需的核实，结果被解雇了。5这场运动开启了一系列清洁工工会的努力，最终在1992年与苹果公司的清洁工签订了一份合同，在惠普公司签订了另一份合同，SEIU 还有数百名新成员。

One of the key tactics used in the union campaign was a publicity attack against Apple, as explained by Mike Garcia, president of SEIU Local 1877: “Apple spends a lot of money on its image and our strategy attacked it. We helped people to understand that the company was exploiting immigrant janitors and we forced Apple to take responsibility – we told Apple ‘it’s your system – you control the contractors; you’re causing the exploitation.工会运动中使用的关键策略之一是公开攻击苹果，SEIU Local 1877的总裁迈克 · 加西亚解释说: “苹果在形象上花了很多钱，而我们的战略攻击了它。我们帮助人们认识到，苹果公司在剥削移民看门人，我们迫使苹果公司承担责任——我们告诉苹果公司: “这是你的系统——你控制着承包商，是你造成了剥削。”。

Workers at a Versatronex factory in Sunnydale, California, striked. The strike was the first in Silicon Valley for years, described as a possible “harbinger of increased organizing activity in this bastion of the non-union shop.” The workers, mainly Latinx 6 circuit board manufacturers, complained of poor training handling hazardous materials and dangerous conditions; the workers eventually won recognition of a union, one of many similar fights in Silicon Valley at the time. 在 Sunnydale 的 Versatronex 工厂，工人们正在罢工。这次罢工是硅谷多年来的第一次，被形容为“这个非工会组织的堡垒里组织活动增加的预兆”这些工人主要是拉丁 x 6电路板制造商，他们抱怨对危险材料和危险条件的培训不力; 工人们最终赢得了工会的承认，这是当时硅谷许多类似斗争中的一个。

The Tech Workers Coalition was founded after full-time tech employees began meeting with and organizing alongside subcontracted workers, including cafeteria workers, security guards, and janitors. These initial meetings helped tech workers learn from each other and allowed tech workers to identify ways they could support subcontracted service workers struggling for unionization and greater economic protections. These forums helped workers across fields recognize their shared interests and needs within the tech industry. Since its founding, TWC has supported various unionization efforts for subcontracted service workers and supported the efforts of tech workers fighting for ethical and political causes within their companies. **技术员工联盟是在全职技术员工开始与包括【自助餐厅员工、保安和看门人在内的转包工人，（角色）】一起开会和组织后成立的**。这些最初的会议帮助技术工人相互学习，让技术工人找到他们可以支持分包服务工人争取组织工会和更大的经济保护的方法。这些论坛帮助各个领域的工作者认识到他们在科技产业中的共同兴趣和需求【策略？】。自成立以来，**TWC 技术员工联盟 一直支持为分包服务工人建立工会的各种努力，并支持技术工人在其公司内为道德和政治事业而奋斗的努力**。

More than 3,100 Google employees signed a petition, demanding that the company end Project Maven — a Pentagon contract that would have seen Google develop artificial intelligence to improve drone targeting by analyzing video imagery.8 The petition followed many heated staff meetings and difficult debates internally and even prompted some Google employees to resign publicly as a form of protest.9 Following the petition, Google was hesitant to end the contract, and it took an additional two months of worker organizing before the company publicly announced that it would not renew Project Maven 3100多名谷歌员工签署了一份请愿书，要求谷歌终止与美国国防部签署的一份合同—— Project Maven。这份合同本可以让谷歌开发人工智能，通过分析视频图像来改善无人机的定位。8这份请愿书是在多次激烈的员工会议和内部艰难的辩论之后签署的，甚至还促使谷歌的一些员工公开辞职，以示抗议。9在请愿书发出之后，谷歌对终止合同犹豫不决，又花了两个月的时间组织工作人员，才公开宣布不会续签 Project Maven

In August 2019, Mijente released a report detailing the ways in which tech companies like Palantir and Amazon were profiting from ICE’s growing digital infrastructure. As part of the #NoTechforICE campaign, college students, tech workers, and the public began petitioning companies to end their contracts with ICE. College students pledged to not work at companies with ICE contracts and organized an international day of action demanding Palantir cancel its contract with ICE. Tech workers protested their companies’ contracts with 10 ICE by publicly quitting or deleting code they had written 2019年8月，Mijente 发布了一份报告，详细介绍了 Palantir 和亚马逊等科技公司从 ICE 不断增长的数字基础设施中获利的方式。作为 # notechforice 运动的一部分，**大学生、技术工作者和公众开始请求公司终止与 ICE 的合同。大学生们承诺不在与 ICE 签订合同的公司工作，并组织了一个国际行动日**，要求 Palantir 取消与 ICE 的合同。技术工人抗议他们的公司与10 ICE 的合同，公开退出或删除他们编写的代码

In September, over 1,500 Amazon employees walked out of work to protest the company’s negative environmental impact. The walk out was historic, the largest corporate walkout in the tech sector in recent memory, following months of organizing internally at Amazon. In advance of the walk out, workers submitted shareholder proposals, organized petitions, and composed a letter demanding the company take greater action in response to climate change. Organizers were inspired by watching similar walkouts at other tech companies, pledging to push the company to reconcile its ethical stances with its actual environmental impacts 9月，超过1500名亚马逊员工罢工，抗议公司对环境的负面影响。这次罢工具有历史意义，是近年来科技行业最大的一次公司罢工，此前亚马逊已经进行了数月的内部组织工作。在罢工之前，工人们提交了股东提案，组织了请愿书，并写了一封信，要求公司采取更大的行动来应对气候变化。组织者受到其他科技公司类似罢工事件的启发，**承诺推动该公司协调其道德立场和实际环境影响**

## Insights from Tech Workers Today

Speaking with those in the industry today can be an invaluable way to prepare for a job in tech. Compiled here are insights from tech workers, academics, entrepreneurs, and former tech workers. Reflecting on their careers and the ethical questions with which they have wrestled, they shared a range of insights helpful to students hoping to create more human-focused tech. Responses below are based on each individual’s experience, but collectively can provide further context for ethical tensions throughout the tech industry. 与当今**行业内人士**交谈，对于准备一份科技行业的工作来说，是一种非常宝贵的方式。这里汇编了来自科技工作者、学者、企业家和前科技工作者的见解。**他们回顾了自己的职业生涯以及一直在努力解决的伦理问题，分享了一系列有助于提供希望创造更加以人为中心的技术的学生以一份见解**。下面的回答是基于每个人的经历，但总体上可以为整个科技行业的道德紧张关系提供进一步的背景。【支持论点的论据】

A former big tech worker who founded a nonprofit focused on tech ethics had a lot to share. Looking back on his post-grad recruiting experience, he wants to encourage students to look beyond corporate jobs. “All companies care about is maximizing profits,” he shared. “If more technical students worked for nonprofits or in the public sector, civil society would be stronger and we’d have more of a counterbalance to corporations.” He also wanted to share with students that the venture capital model incentivizes negative behavior and growth-at-all-costs behavior. Students should consider that forprofit business models that don’t take VC funding may be healthier than VC-backed startups. Similarly, in his experience, companies 12 who are listed on public markets are typically more accountable than private companies. There are also a number of nonprofit or government actors researching AI and building products that are worth exploring as students begin their careers in tech. 一位前大科技工作者创立了一个致力于科技道德的**非盈利组织**，他有很多东西可以分享。回顾自己毕业后的招聘经历，他希望**鼓励学生把眼光放到企业工作之外**。“所有的公司都关心利润最大化,”他分享道。“**如果有更多的技术学生在非营利组织或公共部门工作，公民社会就会更加强大，我们就会有更多的制衡力量来对抗企业**。”他还想与学生们分享，风险投资模式鼓励消极行为和不惜一切代价增长的行为。**学生们应该考虑不接受风险投资的盈利性商业模式可能比风险投资支持的创业公司更健康（？？这句什么意思**）。同样，根据他的经验，在公开市场上市的12家公司通常比私营公司更负责任。**还有一些非营利组织或政府机构研究人工智能和建筑产品，值得探索**，因为学生开始他们的职业生涯在技术。【更多的工作于非营利组织，可以解决技术领域的道德问题？更负责任，公民社会更强大，能对抗盈利性商业企业】

These days, there’s a lot of talk about the “ethical use of AI.” One expert suggested that instead of thinking about ethics, workers and companies need to spend more time developing operational discipline and accountability systems when developing products and for product-use. This former tech worker who now works in academia recommends tech companies need to look beyond internal stakeholders and bring in independent, external parties to look critically at product operations and oversight. For example, if you are about to launch a product, what’s the process in which that product launches? How do you test its relationship to existing unethical systems? How does identity link into the product you are building? Also, how we characterize identity given it is fluctuating and complex? 最近，有很多关于“人工智能的道德使用”的讨论一位专家建议，在开发产品和产品使用时，**工人和公司需要花更多时间发展业务纪律和问责制度，而不是考虑道德问题**。这位现在在学术界工作的前科技工作者建议，**科技公司需要超越内部利益相关者，引入独立的外部各方，以批判性的眼光看待产品运营和监督**。例如，如果你准备发布一个产品，那么这个产品发布的过程是怎样的？你如何测试它与现有不道德体系的关系？如何将身份链接到您正在构建的产品中？同时，我们如何刻画它的波动性和复杂性的同一性？ 【反面，不应该专门考虑道德问题？？？专注于内部利益相关者以外的东西，如产品本身的质量？？脱离道德问题之后的质量？？】

In addition to these questions, it is important to note that sometimes conversations around ethics can be limited in scope. Thus, encouraging companies to listen to a range of stakeholders can push companies to go beyond infusing work with ethical guidelines. It can place a focus on allowing individuals impacted by the technology to be involved in how tech is developed, launched, and utilized. Those who will be most impacted have the greatest stake in the technology and thus must be provided the space and power to push back. There may not be a perfect system to avoid ethical challenges, but involving multiple perspectives is a key way to ensure folks have the opportunity to address a problem as soon as they see it. 除了这些问题之外，有必要注意的是，有时**围绕道德的讨论可能会受到范围的限制**。因此，**鼓励公司倾听一系列利益相关者的意见，可以推动公司超越将道德准则注入工作的范畴**。它可以把重点放在允许受到技术影响的个人，去参与技术的开发、发布和利用。那些将受到最大影响的人在技术上有最大的利害关系，因此必须提供空间和力量来推回。也许没有一个完美的系统来避免道德挑战，但是涉及到多个视角是确保人们一旦看到问题就有机会解决它的一个关键方法。【正面，学生来改善科技领域道德的问题本身压倒性，但改变不是不可能，但需要相关利益者的推动。他们得参与开发，迫使企业考虑道德问题，作为一种解决问题的推力】

Students applying to or starting jobs in large tech companies should educate themselves on governance inside the company. Are coworkers sharing information with one another, or is information being kept by one team alone? What’s the difference between the public and private rationale for sharing information? Is there information flow across the company outside of management? What are the internal mechanics for pursuing an idea? Does the internal bureaucracy work to support that or prevent tracking the flow of ideas? Can workers seek clarification from management and coworkers about the products the company is working on and how those products are being used? What protections are in place for workers who may have a different opinion from management about a new tool? 申请或开始在大型科技公司工作的学生应该了解公司内部的治理。是同事之间共享信息，还是信息只由一个团队保存？公共和私人信息共享的基本原理有什么不同？管理层以外的公司是否有信息流动？追求一个想法的内在机制是什么？内部的官僚机构是支持这一点还是阻止跟踪想法的流动？员工是否可以要求管理层和同事澄清公司正在开发的产品以及这些产品是如何使用的？对于那些可能与管理层对新工具有不同意见的工人，有什么保护措施？【补充？？不知道正反，，学生本身也得学习公司内部治理，足够了解公司监管制度。员工想法是否能被采取，受到保护。、公司内部消息很重要，道德伦理问题方面，公司到底能不能保证产品不会产生危害，，如果有的话员工到底能不能追问】

* If these answers are difficult to track down, it’s possible to do your own information gathering across internal company resources. You can also ask management what safeguards, if any, are in place to make sure no harm is caused by the product you’re developing. It’s important to realize that the information you have access to inside the company is information that the general public might never see, so gathering information and sharing it with your coworkers can be crucial. Doing so can start a necessary dialogue among workers about some of the ethical challenges of developing a particular product. Only these types of conversations can help workers decide if and how the company should continue to be involved in the development of a product.如果这些答案很难找到，你可以自己在公司内部资源中搜集信息。**你也可以询问管理层，如果有的话，有什么保障措施来确保你正在开发的产品不会造成伤害。重要的是要认识到，你可以接触到的公司内部信息是普通公众可能永远不会看到的信息，因此收集信息并与你的同事分享可能是至关重要的。这样做可以在工人之间就开发特定产品的一些道德挑战展开必要的对话**。只有这些类型的对话才能帮助员工决定公司是否以及如何继续参与产品的开发。【正面，通过这个论据，，提前认识，能够帮助解决一些道德挑战】

At startups, questions about ethical contracts are likely to have a more direct impact on the bottom line than at large companies. While you will have more direct access to decision makers to discuss concerns, smaller companies are more likely to be in a financial crunch and possibly resistant to making decisions for ethical reasons. 在创业公司，有关道德合同的问题可能比大公司更直接地影响到底线。虽然你可以更直接地与决策者讨论问题，但**小公司更有可能陷入财务危机，并可能出于道德原因而拒绝做出决定**。【反面，继续证明困难：大公司涉及道德问题，小公司也不例外，即使能直接与决策者讨论，不会有过多想法流动的阻碍】

Business leaders also need to understand the long-term impacts of doing unethical work. Writing in The New York Times, Kevin Roose pointed to an example of how Dow Chemical’s $4 million research and development contract to help the military develop napalm during the Vietnam War cost the company many times that amount in long term brand reputation. Open 13 dialogue and ethical choices early on can help companies avoid these pitfalls and their associated economic costs down the road. **商业领袖还需要了解从事不道德工作的长期影响**。凯文 · 卢斯在《纽约时报》上发表文章，举了一个例子，说明在越南战争期间，陶氏化学公司为了帮助军方开发凝固汽油弹，签订了一份价值400万美元的研发合同。开放13对话和道德选择可以帮助公司避免这些陷阱及其相关的经济成本。

Tech companies, despite their public stances to the contrary, are far from apolitical actors. Google, for example, sought to forbid political discussion at work until the National Labor Relations Board 14 forced them to allow such discussions. Earlier this year, Wayfair staff 15 walked out in protest of the company’s contract to sell furniture to immigrant detention centers and, in response, its CEO, said he’d like staff that join the company to be “non-political.” 尽管科技公司的公众立场与此相反，但它们远非政治行为者。例如，谷歌曾试图禁止在工作中进行政治讨论，直到美国国家劳工关系委员会第14届会议迫使他们允许这样的讨论。今年早些时候，Wayfair 的15名员工为了抗议该公司向移民拘留中心出售家具的合同而罢工。作为回应，该公司的首席执行官表示，他希望加入公司的员工“不带政治色彩”

Additionally, algorithms and databases are inherently political. As policymakers continue to rely on AI to make decisions, the human biases coded into these new technologies have real world political ramifications. For example, an algorithm designed by Northpointe was used by parole authorities in the United States to predict a criminal defendant’s likelihood of recidivism. The algorithm was incorrectly judging Black defendants as having a higher risk of recidivism than white defendants. Human biases that are programed into the 17 software deepened systemic discrimination. 此外，**算法和数据库本质上是政治性的。随着决策者继续依赖人工智能来做决定，编码在这些新技术中的人类偏见在现实世界中产生了政治影响**。例如，美国假释机构使用 Northpointe 设计的算法来预测刑事被告的累犯可能性。**算法错误地判断**黑人被告比白人被告有更高的再犯风险。编入17个软件的人类偏见加深了系统性歧视。【重要性，，改善技术领域道德问题的重要性，误判

It’s critical for students, and society at large, to identify and recognize the importance of transparency and oversight when developing and implementing AI technologies to ensure social harms are not compounded and legitimized under the guise of technological efficiency.**在开发和实施人工智能技术时，确认和认识到透明度和监督的重要性对于学生和整个社会都至关重要，以确保社会危害不会以技术效率为幌子加剧和合法化**。【相关论据？社会监管的重要性，，而不是学生本身一个人能决定改善道德问题的

## Addressing Ethical Issues as a Tech Worker 

After reflecting on the timeline of tech worker organizing and the insights provided by current tech workers, you’ve probably been able to identify key takeaways for the steps you can take as a tech worker to positively shape the future of the tech industry. Here are just a few suggestions to help you on your path: 在反思了技术工作者的组织时间表和当前技术工作者提供的见解之后，你可能已经能够找出作为一名技术工作者**可以采取的积极塑造技术产业未来的关键步骤【如何改进的关键步骤**】。这里有一些建议可以帮助你走上正轨:

Be Proactive

Workers can proactively address ethical issues before they ever come to fruition. First, develop a strong ethical framework. Incorporate multiple perspectives and develop accountability systems so that folks are given continuous opportunities to reflect on and discuss their work and flag potential issues. Additionally, consider all the ways in which a new tool could be abused. Are there safety measures that can be put in place? By thinking through the worst possible outcomes, tech workers can make the decisions necessary to protect the public from the negative impacts of misguided or abused technological tools **员工可以在道德问题取得成果之前主动解决它们**。首先，建立一个强有力的道德框架。纳入多重视角，发展问责制度，使人们有不断的机会反思和讨论他们的工作，并标记潜在的问题。**另外，考虑一下新工具可能被滥用的所有方式。是否有可以采取的安全措施？通过考虑最坏的可能结果，技术工作者可以做出必要的决定，保护公众免受误导或滥用技术工具的负面影响** 【技术工作者本身可以帮助解决一些道德问题，，在产生后果之前】

Build Relationships

Building strong relationships is an essential organizing ingredient, especially when tackling ethical challenges. If you feel something is not right, other people in your company probably feel similarly. But, without strong relationships, folks may not trust that it is safe to speak out. Additionally, when planning actions, sending around petitions, or meeting with management, workers must trust that they have each other’s backs in these often intimidating situations.**建立牢固的人际关系是必不可少的组织要素，尤其是在应对道德挑战时**。如果你觉得有什么地方不对劲，你公司的其他人可能也会有同样的感觉。但是，没有牢固的关系，人们可能不相信说出来是安全的。**此外，在计划行动、发送请愿书或与管理层会面时，员工必须相信，在这些常常令人生畏的情况下，他们会相互支持**。【其他论据，，，，坚固人际关系对于解决道德挑战很重要】

Talk Across Teams

* The tech industry often perpetuates the mythology of the lone individual who has a breakthrough idea that changes the world. Yet the reality is that within tech, folks work in teams where each member is deeply reliant on each other. While this can be a fun, collaborative opportunity, it can be complicated to step forward with an ethical concern. 科技产业经常延续孤独的个人拥有改变世界的突破性想法的神话。然而现实是，在技术领域，**人们在团队中工作，每个成员都深深地依赖于彼此。虽然这可能是一个有趣的、合作的机会，但是【带着道德上的顾虑向前迈进可能会很复杂**】。【反面，还是很难改善】
* No one wants to disrupt the team or be seen as the black sheep. So, talking across teams can help workers discuss their concerns before bringing them up with the people they work with most closely. “Ethics lunches” can be a low-stakes way for folks to come together across teams and discuss the possible ethical ramifications for their individual projects. This dialogue is necessary to identify if a project is producing unethical outcomes, and if other workers feel emboldened to mobilize and demand change
没有人想要破坏这个团队，或者被视为害群之马。因此，【**跨团队的交流】可以帮助员工在与他们最亲密的同事交流之前讨论他们的担忧**。“道德午餐”是一种低风险的方式，让人们**跨团队聚在一起，讨论个人项目可能产生的道德后果**。这种对话对于确定一个项目是否正在产生不道德的结果，以及其他工人是否有胆量动员和要求变革是必要的 【支撑论据，跨团队交流解决这种道德问题难以解决 的困难。所以改善科技行业的道德问题还是可能的】

Work with Impacted Communities

Involving diverse communities in user testing can help companies proactively understand how their tool would impact the community. When attempting to draw attention to ethical concerns, it is important to identify and center the communities negatively impacted by the unethical practice. Tech spends a lot of time wowing us with what works. Not enough time is spent discovering who tech doesn’t work for. Frontline communities who experience the negative impacts of unethical tech practices are already organizing against those technologies. By supporting those movements and providing technical insights, tech workers can support and build power for the movement work already being led by those most impacted. **让不同的社区参与用户测试可以帮助公司积极地了解他们的工具将如何影响社区。当试图引起人们对伦理问题的关注时，重要的是要确定和关注受到不道德行为负面影响的社区**。技术人员花了很多时间让我们惊叹于那些有用的东西。没有足够的时间去发现谁不为科技工作。遭受不道德技术行为负面影响的一线社区已经组织起来反对这些技术。通过支持这些运动和提供技术见解，技术工作者可以支持和建立运动工作的权力已经由那些最受影响的领导。【公众社区参与产品使用，如果涉及严重伦理问题肯定会引起相应。能

Learn Organizing Strategies

There are so many organizing tools available to tech workers. From petitions, protests, media pieces, coalition building, there are a multitude of tools that organizers can use to draw attention to unethical practices and encourage their company to be accountable to the impact of their policies. By learning what tools are available and how they can be employed for change, future tech workers can be better prepared to demand positive change and ensure safer tech for all. **对于技术工作者来说，有很多组织工具可以使用**。从请愿书、抗议活动、媒体报道、联盟建设，**组织者可以使用多种工具来引起人们对不道德行为的注意，并鼓励他们的公司对其政策的影响负责**。**通过了解现有的工具以及如何利用这些工具进行变革，未来的技术工作者可以更好地准备要求积极的变革，并确保为所有人提供更安全的技术**。 【使用组织工具来改善】

## Summary

因此，学生角色改善科技行业的道德问题可能很难，但并非不可能。（（解决这种问题很重要。中间有几点提到了。】
