TLS 1.3支持0-RTT连接的重建，以减少连接到以前已知的TLS 1.3服务器的时间。解释0-RTT连接重新建立是如何工作的，以及为什么它能提高性能。说明0-RTT连接重新建立的内在风险是什么。讨论一下**你是否认为0-RTT连接重建的好处超过了风险**，并简要说明你的答案。 TLS 1.3 supports 0-RTT connection re-establishment to reduce the time it takes to connect to a previously known TLS 1.3 server. Explain how 0-RTT connection re-establishment works, and why it improves performance. State what are the risks inherent in 0-RTT connection re-establishment. Discuss whether you think the benefits of 0-RTT connection re-establishment outweigh the risks, and briefly justify your answer

当使用TLS 1.3和TCP时，在TCP连接中发送的数据是加密的，但TCP头仍然是未加密的。这就暴露了TCP的序列号和确认号，控制位，如SYN和FIN，以及TCP扩展的内容，如选择性确认（SACK）块，给网络中的设备。**当使用QUIC传输协议时，相应的头信息是加密的。讨论一下为什么QUIC的设计者选择加密传输头信息。举例说明你的答案** When using TLS 1.3 with TCP, the data sent within the TCP connection is encrypted, but the TCP headers remain unencrypted. This exposes the TCP sequence and acknowledgement numbers, control bits such as SYN and FIN, and the contents of TCP extensions such as selective acknowledgement (SACK) blocks to devices in the network. When using the QUIC transport protocol, the corresponding header information is encrypted. Discuss why the designers of QUIC chose to encrypt the transport header information. Give examples to illustrate your answer

TCP数据包包含一个序列号，接收方在其响应中确认连续收到的最高序列号。如果发送方看到同一序列号有三个或更多的连续重复确认，就会重传一个丢失的数据包。**解释为什么TCP的重传阈值被选择为同一序列号的连续三次重复确认。讨论一下将重传阈值设置为连续两次或四次重复确认会有什么影响**。 TCP packets contain a sequence number, and the receiver acknowledges the highest contiguously received sequence number in its responses. The sender retransmits a lost packet if it sees three or more consecutive duplicate acknowledgements for the same sequence number. Explain why the threshold for retransmission for TCP was chosen to be three consecutive duplicate acknowledgements of the same sequence number. Discuss what would be the effect of setting the retransmission threshold to either two or four consecutive duplicate acknowledgements instead.

除了对丢包作出反应外，TCP（和QUIC）还可以对显性拥塞通知（ECN）信号作出反应。说明什么是ECN，以及它是如何与IP和TCP结合的。解释ECN如何用于向接收方发出拥塞信号，以及如何将拥塞情况反馈给发送方。说说发送方对ECN拥塞报告的反应。 In addition to reacting to packet loss, TCP (and QUIC) can respond to explicit congestion notification (ECN) signals. State what is ECN, and how it integrates with IP and TCP. Explain how ECN is used to signal the onset of congestion to the receiver, and how congestion is reported back to the sender. Say how the sender reacts to an ECN congestion report

视频会议应用使用实时传输协议（RTP），在UDP/IP上运行，以传输视听数据。RTP将语音和视频数据从发送方发送到接收方，并返回关于数据包丢失和接收时间的反馈，可用于拥堵控制和监测接收质量。RTP的一个扩展让发送方将包含音频/视频数据的数据包标记为ECN能力，并允许接收方报告收到的RTP数据包是否包含ECN拥堵经验标记。讨论为什么ECN的使用有利于互动视频会议的应用 Video conferencing applications use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), running over UDP/IP, to transmit audio-visual data. RTP sends speech and video data from sender to receiver, and returns feedback on packet loss and reception times that can be used for congestion control and to monitor reception quality. An extension to RTP lets the sender mark the packets containing audio/visual data as ECN capable, and allows the receiver to report whether the received RTP packets contained ECN congestion experienced marks. Discuss why the use of ECN is beneficial for interactive video conferencing applications

许多应用程序使用域名系统（DNS）来映射主机名称和IP地址。DNS是一个全球分布的数据库，但依靠众所周知的根名称服务器来寻找层次结构中的顶级域。想象一下，一些灾难性的故障发生，导致DNS根名称服务器同时失效，并停止回答查询。讨论这样一个完全的DNS故障的影响将如何表现出来，以及它们将如何迅速变得明显 Many applications use the Domain Name System (DNS) to map between host names and IP addresses. The DNS is a globally distributed database, but relies on well-known root name servers to find the top-level domains in the hierarchy. Imagine some catastrophic failure occurs, causing the DNS root name servers to fail simultaneously, and stop answering queries. Discuss how the effects of such a total DNS failure would manifest themselves, and how quickly they would become visible

DNS最初是使用UDP作为其传输协议部署的。解释为什么UDP曾经是DNS的一个很好的选择，并讨论为什么DNS现在转而使用其他传输协议。 The DNS was originally deployed using UDP as its transport protocol. Explain why UDP used to be a good choice for DNS, and discuss why the DNS is now switching to use alternative transport protocols.

解释什么是DNS-over-HTTPS，并讨论为什么其部署被证明是有争议的。讨论你是否认为部署DNS-over-HTTPS在整体上是有益的。 Explain what is DNS-over-HTTPS, and discuss why its deployment has proven to be controversial. Discuss whether you think deployment of DNS-over-HTTPS is beneficial overall.



You have just moved home, and are looking to provision Internet access for your new apartment. Two providers offer Internet service where you live. Provider A offers you a link with average bandwidth but low latency, whereas Provider B is offering a link with average latency but much higher bandwidth. Both services are the same price. Which of the two services do you purchase? Justify your answer, stating what types of application you intend to use, their characteristics, and how those characteristics influence your choice of provider


Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are now making extensive use of video conferencing applications, such as Webex, Zoom, and Teams. Some users report that these video conferencing applications perform poorly when sharing their residential access link with other traffic, but that this problem can often be fixed by configuring their router to make less buffer space available to store packets. Explain why reducing the amount of memory in routers can improve performance


TCP Reno congestion control uses an additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm to vary the sliding window size during the congestion avoidance phase of a connection. With reference to the AIMD parameters α and β, describe how TCP Reno senders vary the window size using the AIMD algorithm during the congestion avoidance phase of a TCP connection. Discuss why this approach is problematic for interactive video conferencing applications that share a link with such TCP flows.


The Internet is often described as a network of networks. What is the relation between a network and an Autonomous System (AS) as used in BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing?


DNS queries were traditionally sent in UDP packets. Explain why TCP was not considered an appropriate protocol for transporting queries in the original design of DNS. Discuss what has changed that makes modern DNS resolvers increasingly use TCP for transport DNS queries.

There are two aspects to DNS security: transport security and record security. Briefly explain what type of threat each of these protects against, and discuss which aspect of DNS security is likely to give the biggest improvement to Internet security today
