So that's the goal of this exercise to give us those techniques that we can apply. In a systematic way to drive towards an exponential outcome for products that we may launch
所以这个练习的目的就是为我们提供那些我们可以应用的技术。以一种系统化的方式推动我们可能推出的产品达到指数级的结果

expotential growth

the more users you have, the faster you grow (desired achievements)

* study the techinque(adapted and extends ) and could be applied everywhere

增长工程创建&捕获&利用复合增长效应 Growth Engineering creates and exploits Compounding Growth effects

# Compounding Growth (Generic)

* 右，吸引多个用户使用软件
* 左，被邀请的用户最后又变成新的使用用户，并吸引**邀请**其他用户

what is compuonding growth loops - rate of user growth is proportional to the number of users that are currently using the product, 用户增长速度与当前使用产品的用户数量成正比。

## loop例子

* good example, the company never stop and try to add other type of loop (and run simultaneously)
* Direct Invitational Loop
  * user as the currency for the loop
  * more users we had, the faster the loop

* Content-Driven Loop
  * content as the currency
  * more contents we have, the faster loop spends

Growth Engineering models and optimizes the entire user journey

## How things used to be

* 左侧，只关心吸引用户，运营策略，不关心用户是否持续使用产品
* 为产品添加新特性（假设新特性能吸引用户
  * 但是往往不符合实际中用户行为，一般需要遵循user journey

## User Journey

![](/static/2021-03-09-21-57-38.png)

* bring users to their habit state,(built in in minds, like when I wanna buy something I consider amazon,...)
* if can keep the habit state, we can show users the products ads or charge them subscription, Also can refer other users to the products

## Putting the Growth Model together into User journey

![](/static/2021-03-09-22-05-25.png)

* optimise user journey
* in refer new users
  * generate referrals for the compounding growth loop
    * heart of the modern growth model

# Where do we get initial users come from

![](/static/2021-03-09-22-07-20.png)

* use linear marketing

![](/static/2021-03-09-22-07-54.png)

* Use Linear Marketing to attract initial and further users
  * paid marketing
  * search engine optimization
  * some paid marketing(public relation events, stories in magazines & websites)

# Final Growth Model

growth engineering is systematic

* start from having the growth model as the basis

# User Journey

![](/static/2021-03-16-21-36-14.png)

* **retain in a habitual state**
  * form a habit around the product
  * or can we in that state(only) to monetize the users (shows the ads, charging them subscriptions when users are using the products)

* referring other users to the product
  * as the fuel of compouding growth loops, important state (**but retetion is more important**)

* each year of the users retention forms the baseline of next year, without it won't have a big growth
* retention is the fundation of compounding growth
* also retention is the foundation of monetization

# Zero Churn

![](/static/2021-03-16-21-54-30.png)

* active users grows, and stops and certain points(size limitation of the market)
  * market saturates
* but if have zero churn, won't loose any users
  * week 9 ~ 10
  * so can continue monetize users

# 1% Churn

![](/static/2021-03-16-22-06-47.png)

* every point 1% decrease of inactive users
* **slowly** lose users overtime
  * since at certain point, cannot find more users to sign up
  * but since **it's slow**, there are many approches to improve it, add more users cases , features, or open other markets to keep growth going

# 33% churns

![](/static/2021-03-16-22-10-35.png)

* every time 1/3 usres are lossed from previous time
* jump shark phenomenon

so if no user retention(or no attention to it, no use right with retention), gonna run out of users to sign up and eventually all the users go away i.e. jumping the shark is back

# cohort of users

cohort means users who sign up at given time period

* e.g. the cohort of users in time period 5, would be the users who sign up at time period 5

# retention-cohort graph

* green line
  * lose users before they formed the habit
* yellow line
  * can take some approches to line up or just attain in this level
  * earlier warning

# Retention is a trend, not a number

follow the trend pattern, if direction is not right, make changes
