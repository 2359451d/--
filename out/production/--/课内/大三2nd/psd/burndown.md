# 项目速率

Project velocity is the relationship between actual project process (number of tasks completed) and the number of tasks expected to be completed through the project iteration. You can visualise project velocity as a burndown chart.项目速度是实际项目进程（已完成的任务数）与预期通过项目迭代完成的任务数之间的关系。你可以将项目速度可视化为一个下线图。

The ideal rate of completion is the dotted line. The arrows are plotted whenever a task is completed. The coordinate for that arrow is the reduction in the number of story points and the time it was completed.

虚线是理想的完成率。每当一项任务完成后，就会画出箭头。该箭头的坐标是故事点数量的减少和完成的时间。The ideal rate of completion is the dotted line. The arrows are plotted whenever a task is completed. The coordinate for that arrow is the reduction in the number of story points and the time it was completed.
